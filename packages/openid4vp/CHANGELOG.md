# @openid4vc/openid4vp

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- edd7464: update the parsed dcql vp_token presentation result to always return an array of presentations
- 7904088: feat: support multi-presentation submission for transaction data (dcql multiple feature)
- 16e5b1c: feat: add support for `x509_hash` client id scheme.

  With support for this new client id scheme the `hash` callback is now required in the `Openid4vpClient`, and the `validateOpenid4vpClientId` method is now asynchronous.

- 1b5e003: feat: initial version of openid4vp
- fccae5c: chore: update to zod 4. Although the public API has not changed, it does impact the error messages and some of the error structures
- 06c016f: apu and apv in JWE encryptor are now base64 encoded values, to align with JOSE
- 16e5b1c: refactor: client id scheme to client id prefix.

  All parameters have been changed to use prefix, so .e.g. `scheme` has become `prefix`. Only the parameters referring to the legacy separate `client_id_scheme` are still called scheme.

- 16e5b1c: feat: support the new `origin:` client id prefix in addition to `web-origin:` for the DC API.

  NOTE that for unsigned requests over the DC API, the `client_id` should be omitted, and you need to calculate the effective client id. Up to draft 25 this was `web-origin:<origin>` and after draft 25 it's `origin:<origin>`. It's not always possible to detect which prefix needs to be used, so if you're a verifier that wants to support both draft versions with the DC API, make sure to allow both prefixes for the session binding of presentations.

- 16e5b1c: add support for response encryption without leveraging JARM.

  Both the JARM-based response encryption, and the new OID4VP-based response encryption methods are supported. Both methods are used to determine which alg and enc values to use, and you should provide the same `jarm` configuration options. Once support for pre-1.0 drafts will be removed, the JARM options will also be replaced with a more OID4VP aligned API.

- 16e5b1c: feat: add support for draft 27 vp_formats_supported
- f798259: refactor: change the jwt signer method 'trustChain' to 'federation' and make 'trustChain' variable optional.
- 16e5b1c: feat: add support for the new `decentralized_identifier` and `openid_federation` client id schemes.

  The client information is also updated to return the `decentralized_identifier` and `openid_federation` scheme. The `effective` client is the value that should be used for comparison.

- edd7464: feat: update openid4vp to 1.0 final.

  The `version` returned in the `resolveOpenid4vpAuthorizationRequest` now returns `100` instead of `29` for the 1.0 final version of OpenID4VP.
