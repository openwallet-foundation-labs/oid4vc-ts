# @openid4vc/oauth2

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 70b9740: Add support for OpenID4VCI draft 15. It also includes improved support for client (wallet) attestations, and better support for server side verification.

  Due to the changes between Draft 14 and Draft 15 and it's up to the caller of this library to handle the difference between the versions. Draft 11 is still supported based on Draft 14 syntax (and thus will be automatically converted).

- fccae5c: chore: update to zod 4. Although the public API has not changed, it does impact the error messages and some of the error structures
- 06c016f: apu and apv in JWE encryptor are now base64 encoded values, to align with JOSE
- 70b9740: fix typo in param from authorizationServerMetata to authorizationServerMetadata
- 70b9740: replace the `dpopJwk` return value with `dpop` object with `jwk` key. It now also returns the `jwkThumbprint`
- 26451d7: Before this PR, all packages used Valibot for data validation.
  We have now fully transitioned to Zod. This introduces obvious breaking changes for some packages that re-exported Valibot types or schemas for example.
- f798259: refactor: change the jwt signer method 'trustChain' to 'federation' and make 'trustChain' variable optional.
- c23c86f: add support for sha-384, sha-512, rename SHA-256 to sha-256 to align with IANA hash algorithm names (https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml)

### Patch Changes

- 08dbc00: Add grant_types_supported to the authorization server metadata.
- a70c87b: fix: make key_ops array of strings instead of string in jwk
- 5b69ca4: Fixes miscellaneous typos and adds code to the authorization request.
- e206509: Add support for deferred credential issuance and Draft 16 of the OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance.
- 2cc4e31: Add function to parse authorization response redirect URLs.
- e206509: Fix a myriad of typos across errors, comments, and variable names.
- c8ce780: fix: path where oauth2 authorization server metadata is retrieved from.

  For OAuth you need to put `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` between the origin and path (so `https://funke.animo.id/provider` becomes `https://funke.animo.id/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/provider`). We were putting the well known path after the full issuer url.

  It will now first check the correct path, and fall back to the invalid path.

- e9483ca: Add support for parsing and verifying an ID Token JWT according to the OpenID Connect specification.

  Exports some other utilities.

- 4d1bfd7: Add function to parse a pushed authorization request uri.
- 3b9b88a: fix: create fetch wrapper that always calls toString on URLSearchParams as React Native does not encode this correctly while Node.JS does
- ef05cf9: Correctly passes the state down to the authentication challenge request.
- 1ba4a59: Add support for parsing and verifying array 'aud' in JWTs.
- 80d0ec1: Send redirect_uri along in the authorization challenge endpoint, allowing the server to use it when defaulting to a PAR request.

### Minor Changes
